[{"content":"Hey there.\nMy name is Daniel Millson, thanks for coming by to my blog. This is just a place for me to jot down my thoughts about stuff I\u0026rsquo;m working on or learning about, and I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll find some of the content interesting or inspiring in some way.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a little bit about me. Growing up, I was fortunate to be able to travel, spending most of my pre-university years in South America and various countries in southern Africa, such as South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.\nI had no idea I would end up studying Mathematics and Computer Science until I started at my university, where I ended up enjoying those subjects more than I would have imagined. While may day-to-day job is as a software developer in the financial service industry, I have a passion for learning different subjects in Math (though I\u0026rsquo;m by no means a mathematician).\nOther than writing software and learning Math, my hobbies include reading, cooking, and GeoCaching. I may post some content here regarding those, so keep your eyes out for those!\nAgain, thanks for coming by, and I hope you have a great day.\n","permalink":"https://portobello-boy.github.io/about/","summary":"Hey there.\nMy name is Daniel Millson, thanks for coming by to my blog.
